1. Go is a compiled language, Go program use much less memory
2. Compiler compiles it to binaries.
3. Go is strongly typed and statically types.
4. A small runtime is also compiled with Go for garbage collection and automated memoey management
5. Built in concurrency.

Data Types:

bool
string
int int8 int16 int32 int64
uint uint8  uint16  uint32  uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
    // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128

6. A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

7. go mod has all the modules with version, even that which we will install from outside.

go build <file name>
go run <binary name>

--------------------------

- go has const and var to declare the variable
- Default value for all signed, unsigned ints, floats and runes is zero
- string: '', and for boolean it's false
